  Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should 
  always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword 
  arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a 
  color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
